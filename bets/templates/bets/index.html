			<h5>What is a FGL?</h5>
			<p>Fantasy Gambling League is a game conceived by an uncle of 
			Liam Woulfe and adopted by the ex-residents of Calton Walk. Each week, the Commissioner 
			will publish odds on a group of Premier League games. Players are given a 'fantasy' allowance 
			to bet on those games as they see fit. Once results are in, winnings are calculated and the 
			league table is updated.</p>
			</br>
			</br>
			<h5>How do I play?</h5>
			<p>You'll first need an account. Only way to register at the
			moment is to ask Ollie to get you set up.</p>
			</br>
			</br>
			<h5>What is a Commissioner?</h5>
			<p>The Commissioner is responsible for creating and
			maintaining the season. Season creation can be actioned using the link below. Once a
			season has been created and players have joined, the Commissioner may begin populating
			gameweek odds.</p>
